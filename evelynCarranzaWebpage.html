		<p> Hi! My name is Evelyn Carranza, I am a Senior at UHD and a computer science major. My expected date to graduate is this upcoming spring. I did not start off as a computer science major at UHD. My first plan was to graduate with a Biology degree and go to physical therapy school but during my pre-requisites, I decided that the medical field wasnâ€™t for me. Computer Science was my backup plan if I decided to no longer pursue biology. The reason for that was because I had experience in coding and robotics during high school and I had fun learning about that.

During my free time I like to go to concerts, discover new music, try new food places, spend time in nature with either myself, friends or family. I also have been trying to discover new hobbies like crocheting, maybe give running a chance or creating jewelry as well as pottery. I have tried painting and drawing but I was not born with that talent. A couple of months back, I gave the wrestling club a try and really enjoyed it. It was really hard in the beginning since I have never been in sports before and had been engaging muscles that I have never engaged before, but it was fun. This semester Iâ€™m still trying to decide whether I want to go for fun or go and compete for UHD.
